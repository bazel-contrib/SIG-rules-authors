readme: "# Bazel rules for ts\n\nHigh-performance alternative to the `@bazel/typescript` npm package, based on\nhttps://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js.\n\nThe `ts_project` rule here is identical to the one in rules_nodejs, making it easy to migrate.\n\nSince rules_js always runs tools from the bazel-out tree, rules_ts naturally fixes the usability bugs with rules_nodejs.\n\n- Freely mix generated `*.ts` and `tsconfig.json` files in the bazel-out tree with source files\n- Fixes the need for any `rootDirs` settings in `tsconfig.json` as reported in https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37378\n- \"worker mode\" for `ts_project` now shares workers across all targets, rather than requiring one worker pool per target\n\n## Installation\n\nFrom the release you wish to use:\n<https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/releases>\ncopy the WORKSPACE snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file.\n"
